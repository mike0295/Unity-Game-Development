# Lesson 2

In this lesson, we will create a basis for a 2D platformer game.

The first task is very similar to lesson 1, but only in 2D.

## Task:
* Create a square shaped player
* Create a ground for the player to walk(?) on
* Make the camera follow the player
* Allow player to move left/right using either arrow keys or WASD
* Allow player to jump using space bar
* If you want, try creating platforms for the player to jump onto

### Some info
+ You can use a sprite for the ground, just like what you did in lesson 1
+ Jumping will feel very awkward for now. We will change that in the next lesson
