# Lesson 3-2
Now that you have made a level/stage/**scene** for your game, lets make it look like an actual game!

We will add Main Menu, Pause, and Game Clear UI (User Interface)

## Task
Create Main Menu, Pause, and Game Clear UI using **scenes** in Unity

### Constraints:
* Main Menu scene must have "Start" button and "End Game" button
  + Press "Start" to go into the game stage you have created last lesson
  + Press "End Game" to (attempt to) close the game and print "Game Closed" in console
    - The game won't actually close in Unity play mode. It only works after the game build/export 
* Pause scene will have "Continue", "(Go to) Main Menu" button 
* Game Clear scene will have a congratulating message (and maybe your name) and "Main Menu" button
