# 1. Introduction to Beginner Lessons
## 1.1 How much do I have to know?
Absolutely nothing. We will start from the very basics in 3D and 2D game production.
## 1.2 How much will we learn?
At the end of the Beginner Lessons, you will be able to create simple 2D/3D games on your own. In most cases, you will not take into account memory/overhead optimizations.

-------------------

### [Lesson 1: Getting used to Unity](https://github.com/mike0295/Unity-Game-Development/blob/master/Study/Beginner/Lesson1.md)
  
You will create a **very** simple 3D game in Unity, just to get the hang of basic concepts such as **Scenes**, **RigidBody**, **UI**, etc. 

-------------------

### [Lesson 2: Creating a 2D platformer](https://github.com/mike0295/Unity-Game-Development/blob/master/Study/Beginner/Lesson2.md) 
You will create a basis for a 2D game, where a player moves and jumps in a simple platform environment.
You will also learn more concepts of game execution in Unity, such as the difference between Start() and Awake(), Update() and FixedUpdate().
